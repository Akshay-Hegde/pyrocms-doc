# Add-ons

Add-ons are organized bundles of code that you can use to add functionality on to PyroCMS. You can either create your own, or use some of the add-ons available on the [PyroCMS store](http://www.pyrocms.com/store). 

Add-ons are organized into four different types based on their structure and use: **Plugins**, **Widgets**, **Field Types**, and **Modules** .

## The PyroCMS Store

The official listing of PyroCMS add-ons is on the [PyroCMS store](http://www.pyrocms.com/store). Despite the name, many of the add-ons found on the store are free. If you have created an add-on and would like to have it available on the PyroCMS store, you can [submit](http://www.pyrocms.com/store/add) it for review.

## Creating Your Own Add-ons
