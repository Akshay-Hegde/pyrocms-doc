# Sitemap Module

The sitemap module automatically outputs an XML sitemap for use with Google's [Webmaster Tools](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/) and other similar services. 

The sitemap is located at:

	/sitemap.xml

It will map not only your site pages (via the Pages module), but also modules that support the PyroCMS sitemap protocol, such as the Blogs module.
