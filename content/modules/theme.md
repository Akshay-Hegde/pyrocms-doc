# Theme Module

The _theme_ module allows you to choose which theme you'd like to be used on the front end of your website.

## Selecting a Theme

To choose a theme, go into **Design &rarr; Themes** and select the theme that you'd like to use, and click "Save".

## Theme Options

Many themes have theme options which control certain aspects of the display and behavior of themes. If a theme supports theme options, you'll see an **Options** link next to the them. Clicking on it takes you to a theme options page.
