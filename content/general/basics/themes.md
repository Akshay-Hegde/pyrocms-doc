# Themes

Themes are PyroCMS's organizational system for front-end assets and code. In a theme you can have:

* Theme layouts
* Theme partials
* CSS
* JS
* Images

_Note: for more information on master layouts and theme partials, please see the [PyroCMS structure guide](http://www.pyrocms.com/docs/2.0/basics/organization)._

Themes can go in your _addons/&lt;site-ref&gt;/themes_ folder or in your _addons/shared\_addons_ folder and are installed via the control panel under **Design &rarr; Themes**.

You can download themes via the [PyroCMS add-on store](http://www.pyrocms.com/store) or create your own. For more information on themeing PyroCMS, see the [creating a custom theme](http://www.pyrocms.com/docs/2.0/theming-pyrocms/create-a-custom-theme) guide.
