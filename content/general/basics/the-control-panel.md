# The Control Panel

The PyroCMS control panel has been completely redesigned for version 2.0 and has a lot of great new features. Here is a basic tour of what you'll find.

## Logging in

To log into your control panel, go to **yoursite.com/admin**. Enter your email address and password, and you should be good to go!

After you've logged in, you'll see the PyroCMS control panel dashboard:

## The CP Menu

All the sections of your control panel are contained within the top black navigation bar. This nav bar changes with what you have access to (if you are an admin, you'll have access to everything). Things are divided into the following sections:

- **Content:** Modules that deal with your sites content. You can find the pages, widgets, and blog modules in here, among others.
- **Design:** Modules that deal with your site's design structure, such as navigation and themes.
- **Users:** Controls for users, groups, and permissions.
- **Utilities:** Here you can find admin utilities like redirects and maintenance.
- **Settings:** This section holds settings for the entire site, from the site name to language preferences.
- **Add-ons:** A list of currently installed core modules, as well as third party modules. You can install and manage third party modules here.

## Changing the Default Language

PyroCMS comes in many different languages, and to change the language (English, by default), choose a new language from the menu on the right hand side of the footer:
